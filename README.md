I was first exposed to coding during a 2 week workshop the summer prior to starting my undergrad study @NYU
That fall I attended DroidCon NYC and it was clear, tech is where I am meant to be
I switched my major from mechanical engineering to computer engineering and formally started my coding career January 2015.


Since then I have experienced engineering @Lyft, @Bitly, @Clarifai, @PitneyBowes and @ThisAlso
I have experienced teaching engineering with @GirlsWhoCode and @NYU's Department for K12 STEM Education.
