I was first exposed to coding during a 2 week workshop the summer prior to starting my undergrad study @NYU
That fall I attended DroidCon NYC and it was clear, tech is where I am meant to be
I switched my major from mechanical engineering to computer engineering and formally started my coding career January 2015.


Since then I have experienced engineering @Lyft, @Bitly, @Clarifai, @PitneyBowes and @ThisAlso
I have experienced teaching engineering with @GirlsWhoCode and @NYU's Department for K12 STEM Education.



projects

All projects found on my github are in the process of becoming demoable or having some type of easily demoable component.
Have fun, go nuts, fork my shit, share the shit. experience.
